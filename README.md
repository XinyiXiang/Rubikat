# Rubikat
If you have heard of Rubik's Race before, you would probably know it is a fast paced game for two players to get their brains and fingers racing. I enjoyed playing this game a lot that I made this my WWDC submission, hoping to make the game more accessible and can be readily played anytime and anywhere people want to.
