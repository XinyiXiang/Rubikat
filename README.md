# Rubikat
If you have heard of Rubik's Race before, you would probably know it is a fast paced game for two players to get their brains and fingers racing. I enjoyed playing this game a lot that I made this my WWDC submission, hoping to make the game more accessible and can be readily played anytime and anywhere people want to.

This playground was created within 3 days for Apple's WWDC 2021 Swift Student Challenge. To run this playground you need the [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) app (preferrably for macOS). For best experience, use a device with a large screen.

## Initiatives
Simple skills such as color identifying and movement speed was found to be essential in early cognitive development is an essential part of childhood learning, combing with Swift, Rubikat could teach children logical thinking abilities along with cognitive skills, all of these achieved by filling beautiful colors (and they are customizable) and straightforward demonstration from random shuffling.

## Some Features
**Flexible Game Mode**


- By implementing the game on a device, everyone could pace themselves while enjoying the game, and the number of players is no longer limited to two at the time, players could start a game any time they want. However, if players still want to enjoy the thrill of timed games, they could simply choose to start the timer provided in the game scene.

**Situational Learning**

**Randomization (but is randomness really random though)**
